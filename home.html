<p><em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em> is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope
with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.
The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for AA membership; 
we are self-supporting through our own contributions. AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, 
organization, or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes. 
Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.

<p>
<h3>How Does Intergroup Operate?</h3>

All groups in the Piedmont area are encouraged to have an Intergroup Representative to express the group's
conscience, views, and desires at the regularly scheduled Intergroup meeting.
</p>
<p>
Intergroup Represenative meetings are held at the Western Piedmont Intergroup Office, usually on the first 
Monday of the  month at 6:30pm (or as announced). Intergroup meetings are an open forum for all AA members 
and you are cordially invited to attend.

representative and a vote. Donations are much appreciated to continue reaching the Alcoholic who still suffers.
